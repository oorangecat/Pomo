# Simple ESP8266 based pomodoro timer with OLED 

## Needed Hardware:
- ESP8266, any version with i2c pins available. ESP01 cannot work without addictional hardware. 
- SSD1308 OLED
- 2x Buttons + related resistor
- Some way to handle power. I used a 500mah battery with a charging+step up circuit. 

The idea is creating a long lasting, simple to use, pomodoro timer that can be reliably used during long study/work sessions. 
A real prototype was 3d printed and assembled.
